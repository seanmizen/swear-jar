# I Swear too much!

small training project which will (hopefully) help me and my friends to watch their language.

playing around with UX - css stages mediated by JS body edits. hopefully not antipattern.

## TODO
- create firebase application to store all user submissions (perform all the necessary encapsulation with potential context/provider)
- create javascript UI tests - use this as a training project.
- bug: in certain circumstances, user cannot tab on from jar-input field.
- create mobile friendly styles
- convert to useRef instead of HTML ids!
